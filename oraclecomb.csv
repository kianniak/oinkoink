Gazprom,Public,Russian Federation,Environment and Energy,"PJSC Gazprom (Russian: Газпром, IPA: [ɡɐsˈprom]) is a Russian majority state-owned multinational energy corporation headquartered in the Lakhta Center in Saint Petersburg. As of 2019, with sales over $120 billion, it was ranked as the largest publicly listed natural gas company in the world and the largest company in Russia by revenue. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Gazprom was ranked as the 32nd largest public company in the world. The Gazprom name is a contraction of the Russian words gazovaya promyshlennost (газовая промышленность, gas industry). In January 2022, Gazprom displaced Sberbank from the first place in the list of the largest companies in Russia by market capitalization. In 2022, the company's revenue amounted to 8 trillion rubles. In 2023, the company is delisted from international markets, and continues substantial construction in its operational results (such as production, export).Gazprom is vertically integrated and is active in every area of the gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, transport, distribution and marketing, and power generation. In 2018, Gazprom produced twelve percent of the global output of natural gas, producing 497.6 billion cubic meters of natural and associated gas and 15.9 million tonnes of gas condensate. Gazprom then exports the gas through pipelines that the company builds and owns across Russia and abroad, such as Nord Stream 1 and TurkStream. In the same year, Gazprom has proven reserves of 35.1 trillion cubic meters of gas and 1.6 billion tons of gas condensate. Gazprom is also a large oil producer through its subsidiary Gazprom Neft, producing about 41 million tons of oil with reserves amounting to 2 billion tons. The company also has subsidiaries in industrial sectors, including finance, media and aviation, and majority stakes in other companies.Gazprom was created in 1989, when the Soviet Ministry of Gas Industry was converted to a corporation, becoming the first state-run corporate enterprise in the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union's dissolution, Gazprom was privatized, retaining its Russia-based assets. At that time, Gazprom evaded taxes and state regulations and engaged in asset stripping. The company later returned to government control in the early 2000s, and since then, the company has been involved in the Russian government's diplomatic efforts, setting of gas prices, and access to pipelines.The company is majority-owned by the Russian government, via the Federal Agency for State Property Management and Rosneftegaz, while the remaining shares are traded publicly. Gazprom has a listing in the Moscow Exchange and had a market capitalization of US$80.56 billion as of September 2019.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.gazprom-international.com/,"473,800 (fortune500, 2020)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.375,0,-0.781,0.25,0,0,-0.5,0,0,0,-0.5,0,0,0,-0.781,0,-0.375,0,0,0,Mega,0,0,0,0,0,119733,0,0,0.656387665,,

Philip Morris International is often referred to as one of the companies comprising Big Tobacco.Until spun off in March 2008, Philip Morris International was an operating company of Altria. Altria explained the spin-off, arguing PMI would have more ""freedom,"" i.e. leeway outside the responsibilities and standards of American corporate ownership in terms of potential litigation and legislative restrictions to ""pursue sales growth in emerging markets"", while Altria focuses on the American domestic market. The shareholders in Altria at the time were given shares in PMI, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange and other markets.The company's legal seat is in Stamford, Connecticut, but it does not operate in the United States of America. Philip Morris USA, a subsidiary of PMI's former owner American parent Altria group, owns the Philip Morris brands there. PMI's operational headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland.With tobacco being addictive and the single greatest cause of preventable death globally, the company is highly controversial, not least because of its history of obfuscating scientific evidence around the health impacts of smoking.

Freddie Mac,Private,USA,Real Estate,"The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), commonly known as Freddie Mac, is a publicly traded,  government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), headquartered in Tysons, Virginia. The FHLMC was created in 1970 to expand the secondary market for mortgages in the US. Along with the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Freddie Mac buys mortgages, pools them, and sells them as a mortgage-backed security (MBS) to private investors on the open market. This secondary mortgage market increases the supply of money available for mortgage lending and increases the money available for new home purchases. The name ""Freddie Mac"" is a variant of the FHLMC initialism of the company's full name that was adopted officially for ease of identification.On September 7, 2008, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director James B. Lockhart III announced he had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA (see Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). The action has been described as ""one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades"". As of the start of the conservatorship, the United States Department of the Treasury had contracted to acquire US$1 billion in Freddie Mac senior preferred stock, paying at a rate of 10% per year, and the total investment may subsequently rise to as much as US$100 billion. Shares of Freddie Mac stock, however, plummeted to about one U.S. dollar on September 8, 2008, and dropped a further 50% on June 16, 2010, when the stocks delisted due to falling below minimum share prices for the NYSE. In 2008, the yield on U.S Treasury securities rose in anticipation of increased U.S. federal debt. The housing market and economy eventually recovered, making Freddie Mac profitable once again.Freddie Mac is ranked No. 45 on the 2023 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue, and has $3.208 trillion in assets under management.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.freddiemac.com,"6,892 (fortune500, 2020)",North America,0.156,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.266,0,0,0,0,0,0.156,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,0,0,3.302678571,0,0,75125,0,0,,,
Rio Tinto,Public,United Kingdom,Industrial and Manufacturing,"Rio Tinto Group is a British-Australian multinational company that is the world's second-largest metals and mining corporation (behind BHP). It was founded in 1873 when a group of investors purchased a mine complex on the Rio Tinto, in Huelva, Spain, from the Spanish government. It has grown through a long series of mergers and acquisitions. Although primarily focused on extraction of minerals, it also has significant operations in refining, particularly the refining of bauxite and iron ore. It has joint head offices in London, England and Melbourne, Australia.Rio Tinto is a dual-listed company traded on both the London Stock Exchange, where it is a component of the FTSE 100 Index, and the Australian Securities Exchange, where it is a component of the S&P/ASX 200 index. American depositary shares of Rio Tinto's British branch are also traded on the New York Stock Exchange, giving it listings on three major stock exchanges. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, it was ranked the world's 114th-largest public company.In May 2020, to expand the Brockman 4 mine, Rio Tinto demolished a sacred cave in Juukan Gorge, Western Australia, which had evidence of 46,000 years of continual human occupation, and was considered the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continual human occupation through the last Ice Age. The company later apologised for the demolition and CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques subsequently stepped down.Rio Tinto has been widely criticised by environmental groups as well as the government of Norway for the environmental impacts of its mining activities. Claims of severe environmental damage related to its engagement in the Grasberg mine in Indonesia led the Government Pension Fund of Norway to exclude it from its investment portfolio.Academic observers have also expressed concern regarding Rio Tinto's operations in Papua New Guinea, which they allege were one catalyst of the Bougainville separatist crisis. There have also been corruption concerns: In July 2017 the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) announced an investigation of the company's business practices in Guinea.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.riotinto.com,"54,000 (Demandbase, 2022)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0.012,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.013,0,-0.443,0,-0.885,0,Mega,0,0,3.334821429,0,0,55554,1,0,,,

Its headquarters are located in Ludwigshafen, Germany.BASF comprises subsidiaries and joint ventures in more than 80 countries, operating six integrated production sites and 390 other production sites across Europe, Asia, Australia, the Americas and Africa. BASF has customers in over 190 countries and supplies products to a wide variety of industries. Despite its size and global presence, BASF has received relatively little public attention since it abandoned the manufacture and sale of BASF-branded consumer electronics products in the 1990s.The company began as a dye manufacturer in 1865. One of its employees, Fritz Haber, worked with Carl Bosch to invent the Haber-Bosch process by 1912, after which the company grew rapidly. In 1925, the company merged with several other German chemical companies to become the chemicals conglomerate IG Farben. IG Farben would go on to play a major role in the economy of Nazi Germany. It extensively employed forced and slave labor during the Nazi period, and produced the notorious Zyklon B chemical used in The Holocaust. IG Farben was disestablished by the Allies in 1945. BASF was reconstituted from the remnants of IG Farben in 1952. It was part of the German economic miracle, and has since expanded considerably. It has received modern criticism for its poor environmental record.At the end of 2019, the company employed 117,628 people, with over 54,000 in Germany. In 2019, BASF posted sales of €59.3 billion and income from operations before special items of about €4.5 billion. Between 1990 and 2005, the company invested €5.6 billion in Asia, specifically in sites near Nanjing and Shanghai in China and Mangalore in India.

WeWork,Private,USA,Real Estate,"WeWork is an American commercial real estate company that provides flexible shared workspaces for technology startups and services for other enterprises. WeWork designs and builds physical and virtual shared spaces and office services for entrepreneurs and companies. Founded in 2010, it is headquartered in New York City. As of 2018, WeWork managed over 4 million square metres. WeWork's parent company was named The We Company, now WeWork.The company gained mainstream media attention in 2019 with its failed Initial Public Offering (IPO) of company stock. The Wall Street Journal noted that upon the release of its public prospectus in August 2019, the company was ""besieged with criticism over its governance, business model, and ability to turn a profit."" WeWork lost over $2 billion in 2018. In September 2019, following mounting pressure from investors based on disclosures WeWork had made in its S-1 filing for the IPO, company co-founder Adam Neumann resigned from his position as CEO and gave up majority voting control in WeWork. Amid growing investor concerns over its corporate governance, valuation, and outlook for the business, WeWork formally withdrew its S-1 filing and announced the postponing of its IPO. At that time, the reported public valuation of the company was around $10 billion, a reduction from the $47 billion valuation it achieved in January and less than the $12.8 billion it had raised since 2010.In October 2019, Neumann received close to $1.7 billion from stakeholder SoftBank for stepping down from WeWork's board and severing most of his ties to the company. He was retained as a consultant with an annual salary of $46 million. The New York Times called the company's failed effort to go public and related turmoil, ""an implosion unlike any other in the history of start-ups,"" which it attributed to Neumann's questionable tenure and the easy money previously provided to him by SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.wework.com/,"4,300 (Wikipedia, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,0,3.125,0.040178571,0,0,3245,0,0,,,

Exxon Mobil,Public,USA,Environment and Energy,"ExxonMobil Corporation (commonly shortened to Exxon) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation and  the largest direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil. The company, which took its present name in 1999 per the merger of Exxon and Mobil, is vertically integrated across the entire oil and gas industry, and within it is also a chemicals division which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products. ExxonMobil is headquartered in the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas, though officially incorporated in New Jersey.: 1 ExxonMobil's history traces its earliest roots to 1866 with the formation of the Vacuum Oil Company, itself acquired by Standard Oil in 1879. The company that is today known as ExxonMobil grew out of the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (or Jersey Standard for short), the corporate entity which effectively controlled all of Standard Oil prior to its breakup. Jersey Standard grew alongside and with extensive partnership another Standard Oil descendant and its future merger partner, the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), both of which grew bigger by merging with various third companies like Humble Oil (which merged with Jersey Standard) and Vacuum Oil (merged with Socony). Both companies underwent rebranding in the 1960s and early 1970s, and by the time of the 1999 merger, Jersey Standard had been known as Exxon, and Socony known as Mobil. The merger agreement between Exxon and Mobil stipulated that Exxon would buy Mobil and rebrand as ExxonMobil, with Mobil's CEO becoming the vice-chairman of the company.ExxonMobil is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. ExxonMobil since its merger varied from the first to tenth largest publicly traded company by revenue, and has one of the largest market capitalizations out of any company. As of 2023, in the most recent rankings released in the Fortune 500, ExxonMobil was ranked third, and twelfth on the Fortune Global 500. ExxonMobil is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world, the largest oil company headquartered in the Western world, and the largest of the Big Oil companies in both production and market value. ExxonMobil's reserves were 20 billion BOE at the end of 2016 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years. With 21 oil refineries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 4.9 million barrels (780,000 m3), ExxonMobil is the second largest oil refiner in the world, trailing only Sinopec. Approximately 55.56% of the company's shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 were The Vanguard Group (8.15%), BlackRock (6.61%), and State Street Corporation (4.83%).ExxonMobil has been widely criticized, mostly for environmental incidents and its history of climate change denial against the scientific consensus that fossil fuels significantly contribute to global warming. The company is responsible for many oil spills, the largest and most notable of which was the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and itself considered to be one of the world's worst oil spills in terms of damage to the environment. The company has also been the target of accusations of human rights violations, excessive influence on America's foreign policy, and its impact on various societies across the world.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",corporate.exxonmobil.com/en,"62,000 (Annual report, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.445,0,-0.877,0.25,0,0,-0.445,0,0,0,-0.445,0,0,0,-0.714,0,-0.448,0,0,0,Mega,0,11.54908426,12.22689379,0,0,398675,0,0,0.572687225,,

Yamana Gold,Public,USA,Industrial and Manufacturing,"Yamana Gold Inc.  is a Canadian company that owns and operates gold, silver and copper mines in Canada, Chile, Brazil and Argentina. Headquartered in Toronto, the company was founded in 1994 and became listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1995, the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, and the London Stock Exchange in 2020. The company became a gold producer after its 2003 re-restructuring in which Peter Marrone took over as chief executive officer and it merged with Brazilian company Santa Elina Mines Corporation. The combined company was able to use Yamana's access to capital with Santa Elina development properties to bring the Chapada mine into production. From there the company combined with other TSX-listed companies RNC Gold, Desert Sun Mining, Viceroy  Exploration, Northern Orion Resources, Meridian Gold, Osisko Mining and Extorre Gold Mines which each contributed either a producing mine or a development project that was able to come into commercial production. The company was acquired by Pan American Silver in March 2023.The company was able to produce over 1 million ounces of gold per year between 2009 and 2016 until it spun off Brio Gold as a separate company with several of its Brazilian assets. With the company facing criticism for its executive compensation packages and debt load, Daniel Racine replaced Marrone as CEO in 2018 and the company sold its Chapada and Gualcamayo mines.The company has been recognized for its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. in 2021, Yamana Gold was named one of Canada's Best 50 corporate citizens by Corporate Knights.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.yamana.com/,"5,091 (Demandbase, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.5,0,-1,0,Medium,0,21.06828193,4.235473037,0,0,1483,0,0,0.618942731,,

Chevron,Public,USA,Environment and Energy,"Chevron Corporation is an American multinational energy corporation predominantly specializing in oil and gas. The second-largest direct descendant of Standard Oil, and originally known as the Standard Oil Company of California (shortened to Socal or CalSo), it is headquartered in San Ramon, California, and active in more than 180 countries. Within oil and gas, Chevron is vertical integrated and is involved in hydrocarbon exploration, production, refining, marketing and transport, chemicals manufacturing and sales, and power generation.Chevron traces its history back to the 1870s to small California-based oil companies which were acquired by Standard and merged into Standard Oil of California. The company grew quickly on its own after the breakup of Standard Oil by continuing to acquire companies and partnering with others both inside and outside of California, eventually becoming one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. In 1985, Socal merged with the Pittsburgh-based Gulf Oil and rebranded as Chevron; the newly merged company later merged with Texaco in 2001. Today, Chevron manufactures and sells fuels, lubricants, additives, and petrochemicals, primarily in Western North America,  the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea and Australia. In 2018, the company produced an average of 791,000 barrels of net oil-equivalent per day in United States.Chevron is one of the largest companies in the world and the second largest oil company based in the United States by revenue, only behind fellow Standard Oil descendant ExxonMobil. Chevron ranked 10th on the Fortune 500 in 2023. The company is also the last-remaining oil and gas component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since ExxonMobil's exit from the index in 2020.Chevron has been subject to numerous controversies arising out of its activities, the most notable of which being related to its activities and inherited liabilities from its acquisition of Texaco in the Lago Agrio oil field, which include allegations of both Chevron and Texaco collectively dumping 18 billion tons of toxic waste and spilling 17 million gallons of petroleum. Chevron and Texaco's activities were the subject of a lawsuit Chevron lost to Ecuadorian residents defended in Ecuadorian court by Steven Donziger. Due to accusations of Donziger bribing the Ecuadorian court and the subsequent disbarment and criminal contempt charges against Donziger, Chevron was accused by environmentalists and human rights groups of jailing Donziger and compelling the US government to deny Donziger due process of law.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.chevron.com/,"37,498 (Annual report, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.34,0,-0.764,0.25,0,0,-0.431,0,0,0,-0.431,0,0,0,-0.734,0,-0.364,0,0,0,Mega,0,21.32873487,12.48856973,0,0,155600,1,0,0.574889868,,

Ferrari,Public,Italy,Automotive and Parts,"Ferrari S.p.A. (; Italian: [ferˈraːri]) is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello, Italy. Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898–1988), the company built its first car, a sports racing car, in 1940. It adopted its current name in 1945, and began to produce its current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016.The company currently offers a large model range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive cars ever sold at auction. Owing to a combination of its cars, enthusiast culture, and successful licensing deals, in 2019 Ferrari was labelled the world's strongest brand by the financial consultency Brand Finance. As of May 2023 Ferrari is also one of the largest car manufacturers by market capitalisation, with a value of approximately US$52 billion.Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where its team, Scuderia Ferrari, are the series' single oldest and most successful. Scuderia Ferrari have raced since 1929, first in Grand Prix events and later in Formula One, where since 1952 they have fielded fifteen champion drivers, won sixteen Constructors' Championships, and accumulated more race victories, 1–2 finishes, podiums, pole positions, fastest laps and points than any other team in F1 history. Historically, Ferrari was also highly active in sports car racing, where its cars took many victories in races like the Mille Miglia, Targa Florio and 24 Hours of Le Mans, as well as overall victories in the World Sportscar Championship. Scuderia Ferrari fans, commonly called tifosi, are known for their passion and loyalty to the team.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.ferrari.com/,"4,953 (Demandbase, 2022)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.033,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.426,0,0,0,-0.426,0,0,0,-0.01,0,Medium,0,21.86123347,1.512932654,0,0,5423,0,0,0.645374449,,

In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, the RWE Group was ranked as the 297th-largest public company in the world.RWE confirmed in December 2015 that it would separate its renewable energy generation, power grid and retail operations into a separate company, Innogy SE, during 2016, and sell a 10% holding in the business through an initial public offering. The restructuring was prompted by efforts to reduce the group's exposure to nuclear decommissioning costs, required due to a German government policy of closing all nuclear power stations by 2022.In July 2019, RWE's handling of the conflict with activists in the Hambach Forest were strongly criticized in the media. The company finally agreed to refrain from clearing the forest until autumn 2020.In July 2020, RWE completed a far-reaching asset swap deal with E.ON first announced in 2018, whereby the international renewable generation portfolio of E.ON and Innogy were transferred to RWE.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.rwe.com/,"18,218 (Demandbase, 2021)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.215,0.353,-0.213,0.25,0,0.099,-0.213,0,0,0.078,-0.213,0,0,0.357,-0.213,0,-0.21,0,0,0,Large,0,23.00037201,5.104515425,0,0,26473,0,0,0.817180617,,

DSV,Public,Denmark,Transportation and Logistics,"DSV A/S is a Danish transport and logistics company offering global transport services by road, air, sea and train. Since its foundation in 1976 by nine independent Danish hauliers, the company has achieved rapid expansion and international presence, predominantly through a series of strategic competitor acquisitions, some of the most important ones being Samson Transport (1997), DFDS Dan Transport Group (2000), J.H.Bachmann (2004), Frans Maas (2006), ABX LOGISTICS (2008), UTi Worldwide, Inc. (2016), Panalpina Welttransport (Holding) AG (2019) and Agility Global Integrated Logistics (GIL) (2021).With headquarters in Hedehusene (near Copenhagen), Denmark, and offices in more than 80 countries, DSV employs more than 75,000 people and collaborates with partners and agents globally. The company is listed on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen (Copenhagen Stock Exchange) and included in the OMXC25 index as one of the 25 most traded stocks.The company is structured in three divisions, Road, Air & Sea, and Solutions.

In 2022, the company reported a net revenue of DKK 235,665 million.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.dsv.com,"74,178 (Demandbase, 2022)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.01,0,0.25,0,0.051,0,0,0,0.021,0,0,-0.021,0.01,-0.582,0,-0.184,0,0,0,Large,0,25.59735682,9.859702112,0.3,0,33779,0,0,0.759911894,,

General Electric,Public,USA,Environment and Energy,"General Electric Company (GE) is an American multinational conglomerate founded in 1892 and incorporated in the state of New York and headquartered in Boston. The company has several divisions, including aerospace, power, renewable energy, digital industry, additive manufacturing, and venture capital and finance.In 2020, GE ranked among the Fortune 500 as the 33rd largest firm in the United States by gross revenue.

Two employees of GE – Irving Langmuir (1932) and Ivar Giaever (1973) – have been awarded the Nobel Prize.On November 9, 2021, the company announced it would divide itself into three public companies. On July 18, 2022, GE unveiled the brand names of the companies it will create through its planned separation: GE Aerospace, GE HealthCare and GE Vernova. The new companies will be focused on aerospace, healthcare, and energy (renewable energy, power, and digital). The first spin-off of GE HealthCare was finalized on January 4, 2023, with GE holding 19.9% of shares. This will be followed by the spin-off of GE's portfolio of energy businesses which plan to become GE Vernova in 2024. Following these transactions, GE will be an aviation-focused company; GE Aerospace will be the legal successor of the original GE.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.ge.com,"168,000 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0.194,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.179,-0.011,0.255,0,0.178,0,0,0,0.017,-0.023,0.022,0,0.116,-0.036,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,0,13.01832226,24.5891093,0,2.459968927,74198,0,0,0.825991189,,

Shell,Public,United Kingdom,Environment and Energy,"Shell plc is a British multinational oil and gas company headquartered in London, England. Shell is a public limited company with a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and secondary listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. A core component of Big Oil, Shell is the second largest investor-owned oil and gas company in the world by revenue (after ExxonMobil), and among the world's largest companies out of any industry.Shell was formed in 1907 through the merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company of the Netherlands and The ""Shell"" Transport and Trading Company of the United Kingdom. The combined company rapidly became the leading competitor of the American Standard Oil and by 1920 Shell was the largest producer of oil in the world. Shell first entered the chemicals industry in 1929. Shell was one of the ""Seven Sisters"" which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the mid-1970s. In 1964, Shell was a partner in the world's first commercial sea transportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 1970, Shell acquired the mining company Billiton, which it subsequently sold in 1994 and now forms part of BHP. In recent decades gas has become an increasingly important part of Shell's business and Shell acquired BG Group in 2016.Shell is vertically integrated and is active in every area of the oil and gas industry, including exploration, production, refining, transport, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation, and trading. Shell has operations in over 99 countries, produces around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day and has around 44,000 service stations worldwide. As of 31 December 2019, Shell had total proved reserves of 11.1 billion barrels (1.76×109 m3) of oil equivalent. Shell USA, its principal subsidiary in the United States, is one of its largest businesses. Shell holds 44% of Raízen, a publicly-listed joint venture with Cosan, which is the third-largest Brazil-based energy company. In addition to the main Shell brand, the company also owns the Jiffy Lube, Pennzoil and Quaker State brands.Shell is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and had a market capitalisation of US$199 billion on 15 September 2022, the largest of any company listed on the LSE and the 44th-largest of any company in the world. By 2021 revenues, Shell is the second-largest investor-owned oil company in the world (after ExxonMobil), the largest company headquartered in the United Kingdom, the second-largest company headquartered in Europe (after Volkswagen), and the 15th largest company in the world. Until its unification in 2005 as Royal Dutch Shell plc, the firm operated as a dual-listed company, whereby the British and Dutch companies maintained their legal existence and separate listings but operated as a single-unit partnership. From 2005 to 2022, the company had its headquarters in The Hague, its registered office in London and had two types of shares (A and B). In January 2022, the firm merged the A and B shares, moved its headquarters to London, and changed its legal name to Shell plc.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.shell.com,"93,000 (Annual report, 2022)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.402,0.015,-0.68,0.25,0,0.017,-0.443,0,0,0,-0.443,0,0,0.014,-0.675,0,-0.402,0,0,0,Mega,0,25.33956605,11.35763924,8.479944742,2.692605727,381314,1,0,0.610132159,,

Alstom,Public,France,Industrial and Manufacturing,"Alstom is a French multinational rolling stock manufacturer which operates worldwide in rail transport markets. It is active in the fields of passenger transportation, signaling, and locomotives, producing high-speed, suburban, regional and urban trains along with trams.The company and its name (originally spelled Alsthom) was formed by a merger between the electric engineering division of Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (Als) and Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston (thom) in 1928. Significant acquisitions later included the Constructions Électriques de France (1932), shipbuilder Chantiers de l'Atlantique (1976), and parts of ACEC (late-1980s).A merger with parts of the British General Electric Company formed GEC Alsthom in 1989. Throughout the 1990s, the company expanded its holdings in the rail sector, acquiring German rolling stock manufacturer Linke-Hofmann-Busch and Italian rail signaling specialist Sasib Railways. In 1998, GEC Alsthom was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and, later that year, it was rebranded Alstom. At the time, the company was manufacturing railway rolling stock, power generation equipment and ships.In 2003, the company required a €3.2 billion bailout from the French government. As a result, Alstom was compelled to dispose of several of its divisions, including shipbuilding and electrical transmission to Areva, in order to comply with European Union rules on state aid. In 2004, Alstom remained in financial difficulties, having incurred massive unexpected costs (€4 billion) arising from a design flaw inherited from the acquisition of ABB's turbine business, in addition to losses in other business sectors.In 2014, General Electric (GE) announced that it reached a deal to purchase Alstom's power and grid divisions for US$17 billion (€12.4 billion). The deal came under heavy scrutiny from French regulators who saw the business as a strategically important domestic industry. To secure approval, GE agreed to form joint ventures with French companies in power generation and transmission, Alstom's heavy gas turbine business was sold to Ansaldo Energia, and GE agreed to sell Alstom's rail signalling business.

BP,Public,United Kingdom,Environment and Energy,"BP p.l.c. (formerly The British Petroleum Company p.l.c and BP Amoco p.l.c) is a British multinational oil and gas company headquartered in London, England. It is one of the oil and gas ""supermajors"" and one of the world's largest companies measured by revenues and profits. It is a vertically integrated company operating in all areas of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and extraction, refining, distribution and marketing, power generation, and trading.BP's origins date back to the founding of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909, established as a subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company to exploit oil discoveries in Iran. In 1935, it became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and in 1954, adopted the name British Petroleum. In 1959, the company expanded beyond the Middle East to Alaska. British Petroleum acquired majority control of Standard Oil of Ohio in 1978. Formerly majority state-owned, the British government privatised the company in stages between 1979 and 1987. British Petroleum merged with Amoco in 1998, becoming BP Amoco plc, and acquired ARCO and Burmah Castrol in 2000 and Aral AG in 2002. The company's name was shortened to BP p.l.c. in 2001.From 2003 to 2013, BP was a partner in the TNK-BP joint venture in Russia, and as of December 2022 holds a nearly 20% stake in Rosneft - accounting for a third of BP's total production. BP had earlier promised to divest the Rosneft holdings but was unable to find a buyer; instead BP wrote the assets off their books in a $25 billion non-cash charge. As of 31 December 2018, BP had operations in nearly 80 countries, produced around 3.7 million barrels per day (590,000 m3/d) of oil equivalent, and had total proven reserves of 19.945 billion barrels (3.1710×109 m3) of oil equivalent. The company has around 18,700 service stations worldwide, which it operates under the BP brand (worldwide) and under the Amoco brand (in the United States) and the Aral brand (in Germany). Its largest division is BP America in the United States. BP is the fourth-largest investor-owned oil company in the world by 2021 revenues (after ExxonMobil, Shell, and TotalEnergies). BP had a market capitalisation of US$98.36 billion as of 15 September 2022, placing it 122nd in the world, and its Fortune Global 500 rank was 35th in 2022 with revenues of US$164.2 billion. The company's primary stock listing in on the London Stock Exchange, where it is a member of the FTSE 100 Index.From 1988 to 2015, BP was responsible for 1.53% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions. BP has been directly involved in several major environmental and safety incidents. Among them were the 2005 Texas City Refinery explosion, which caused the death of 15 workers and which resulted in a record-setting OSHA fine; Britain's largest oil spill, the wreck of Torrey Canyon in 1967; and the 2006 Prudhoe Bay oil spill, the largest oil spill on Alaska's North Slope, which resulted in a US$25 million civil penalty, the largest per-barrel penalty at that time for an oil spill. BP's worst environmental catastrophe was the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest accidental release of oil into marine waters in history, which leaked about 4.9 million barrels (210 million US gal; 780,000 m3) of oil, causing severe environmental, human health, and economic consequences and serious legal and public relations repercussions for BP, eventually paying more than $4.5 billion in fines and penalties, and an additional $18.7 billion in Clean Water Act-related penalties and other claims, the largest criminal resolution in US history.  Altogether, the oil spill cost the company more than $65 billion.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.bp.com/,"65,900 (Demandbase, 2021)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.257,0.118,-0.484,0.25,0,0.113,-0.314,0,0,0.038,-0.314,0.017,0,0.111,-0.495,0,-0.24,0,-0.017,0,Mega,0,32.9193533,16.29292039,9.684474172,4.520756597,157739,1,0,0.711453744,,

Goodyear Tire and Rubber,Public,USA,Industrial and Manufacturing,"The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is an American multinational tire manufacturing company founded in 1898 by Frank Seiberling and based in Akron, Ohio. Goodyear manufactures tires for passenger vehicles, aviation, commercial trucks, military and police  vehicles, motorcycles, RVs, race cars, and heavy off-road machinery. It also licenses the Goodyear brand to bicycle tires manufacturers, returning from a break in production between 1976 and 2015. As of 2017, Goodyear is one of the top five tire manufacturers along with Bridgestone (Japan), Michelin (France), Continental (Germany) and MRF (India).The company was named after American Charles Goodyear (1800–1860), inventor of vulcanized rubber. The first Goodyear tires became popular because they were easily detachable and required little maintenance. Though Goodyear had been manufacturing airships and balloons since the early 1900s, the first Goodyear advertising blimp flew in 1925. Today, it is one of the most recognizable advertising icons in America.The company is  the sole tire supplier for NASCAR series and the most successful tire supplier in Formula One history, with more starts, wins, and constructors' championships than any other tire supplier.

Fluor,Public,USA,Construction and Materials,"Fluor Corporation is an American multinational engineering and construction firm headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is a holding company that provides services through its subsidiaries in the following areas: oil and gas, industrial and infrastructure, government and power. It is the largest publicly traded engineering & construction company in the Fortune 500 rankings and is listed as 259th overall.Fluor was founded in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, predominantly by building oil refineries, pipelines, and other facilities for the oil and gas industry, at first in California, and then in the Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in the oil and gas industry and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.In the 1990s, Fluor introduced new services like equipment rentals and staffing. Nuclear waste cleanup projects and other environmental work became a significant portion of Fluor's revenues. The company also did projects related to the Manhattan Project, rebuilding after the Iraq War, recovering from Hurricane Katrina and building the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.fluor.com,"40,582 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0.03,0,0.03,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.066,0.144,-0.133,0.26,0,0.271,-0.133,0,0,0.083,-0.133,0,0,0.107,-0.199,0,-0.066,0,-0.044,0,Large,0,31.72630058,13.26045575,14.48187291,4.774531271,12435,0,0,0.837004405,,

Ultra Electronics,Public,United Kingdom,Aerospace and Defense,"Ultra Electronics Holdings is a British defence and security company. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index until it was acquired by Cobham, which is itself owned by Advent International.The company was originally founded as Edward E. Rosen & Co., a manufacturer of headphones and loudspeakers, in 1920. In 1925, a new company, known as Ultra Electric Ltd., was established. During 1930, the firm launched its first all-electric radio receiver; it produced numerous domestic radio receivers around this time. Ultra diversified into aviation during the Second World War, building fuselage elements and engine components. Relaunching itself into the civilian markets following the conflict, Ultra started producing television sets in 1953. In 1961, Ultra's consumer electronics interests became part of Thorn Electrical Industries.During 1977, Ultra Electronics was bought by the Dowty Group and regained its independence via a management buyout in 1993. Into the twenty-first century, it has continued to be an active supplier to the aerospace sector; various companies, including Bombardier Aerospace and Airbus, have chosen to incorporate Ultra Electronics' noise reduction and vibration dampening products onto their aircraft. By 2005, Ultra Electronics was ranked as the 66th biggest aerospace company in the world. In August 2021, the British aerospace and defence company, Cobham, agreed to acquire Ultra Electronics in exchange for £2.6 billion.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.ultra-electronics.com/,"3,855 (Demandbase, 2020)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,5.510204082,17.5,0,13.33333333,6.464317602,1114,0,0,,,

It was considered the largest corporate merger in history during that time. The pharmaceutical and agrochemical divisions of both companies formed Novartis as an independent entity. The name Novartis was based on the Latin terms, “novae artes” (new skills).After the merger, other Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz businesses were sold, or, like Ciba Specialty Chemicals, spun off as independent companies. The Sandoz brand disappeared for three years, but was revived in 2003 when Novartis consolidated its generic drugs businesses into a single subsidiary and named it Sandoz. Novartis divested its agrochemical and genetically modified crops business in 2000 with the spinout of Syngenta in partnership with AstraZeneca, which also divested its agrochemical business. The new company also acquired a series of acquisitions in order to strengthen its core businesses.Novartis is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.novartis.com/,"103,000 (Demandbase, 2022)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0.827,-0.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,0,21.71518268,36.41018529,2.635657615,6.548206081,51742,0,1,0.887665198,,

The majority of its stores are corporate-owned, while franchises are mainly conceded in countries where corporate properties cannot be foreign-owned.Inditex's business is centred around one simple premise: to be quick at responding to the market. Whereas it would take almost a year for a traditional fashion company to get its products out, from conception to runway to stores, for Inditex, this process takes less than two months to replenish stores with new and different products weekly and respond quickly.

Ford Motor,Public,USA,Automotive and Parts,"Ford Motor Company (commonly known as Ford) is an American multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, United States. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand, and luxury cars under its Lincoln brand. Ford also owns a 32% stake in China's Jiangling Motors. It also has joint ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), and Turkey (Ford Otosan). The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power.Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938.Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production. At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe. The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights. During the financial crisis of 2007–08, the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers. Ford Motors has since returned to profitability, and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.

Puma's earliest logo consisted of a square and beast jumping through a D, which was registered, along with the company's name, in 1948.

Comcast,Public,USA,Telecommunications,"Comcast Corporation (formerly known as American Cable Systems and Comcast Holdings, stylized in all caps), incorporated and headquartered in Philadelphia, is the largest American multinational telecommunications and media conglomerate. The corporation is the second-largest broadcasting and cable television company in the world by revenue (behind AT&T), and is also the largest pay-TV company, the largest cable TV company, and largest home Internet service provider in the United States. Comcast is additionally the nation's third-largest home telephone service provider. It provides services to U.S. residential and commercial customers in 40 states and the District of Columbia. As the owner of the international media company NBCUniversal since 2011, Comcast is also a high-volume producer of feature films for theatrical exhibition, over-the-air and cable television programming, and theme park operator.Comcast owns and operates the Xfinity residential cable communications business segment and division; Comcast Business, a commercial services provider; and Xfinity Mobile, an MVNO of Verizon. Through NBCUniversal, it also owns and operates over-the-air national broadcast network channels such as NBC, Telemundo, TeleXitos, and Cozi TV; multiple cable-only channels such as MSNBC, CNBC, USA Network, Syfy, Oxygen, Bravo, and E!; the film studio Universal Pictures; the VOD streaming service Peacock; animation studios DreamWorks Animation, Illumination, Universal Animation Studios and Universal Destinations & Experiences. It also has significant holdings in digital distribution, such as thePlatform, which it acquired in 2006; and ad-tech company FreeWheel, which it acquired in 2014. Since October 2018, it has also been the parent company of Sky Group.Comcast has been criticized and put under intense public scrutiny for a variety of reasons. Its customer satisfaction ratings were among the lowest in the cable industry during the years 2008–2010. It has violated net neutrality practices in the past, and, despite its commitment to a narrow definition of net neutrality, critics advocate a definition that precludes any distinction between Comcast's private network services and the rest of the Internet. Critics also point out a lack of competition in the vast majority of Comcast's service areas; in particular, the limited competition among cable providers. Given its negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that it could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. Its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns. These issues and others led to Comcast being dubbed ""The Worst Company in America"" by The Consumerist in 2010 and 2014.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",corporate.comcast.com,"189,000 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.223,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,0.469907496,21.87670131,38.35015169,0,7.968276856,116385,0,0,0.872246696,,

In 1982, Oneok chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, Oneok bought a new Cities Service Company building still under construction (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The Cities Service Company, undergoing financial difficulties, already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. Oneok realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984.In 2009, Oneok sponsored the construction of Oneok Field, the new Tulsa Drillers minor league baseball stadium in downtown Tulsa.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.oneok.com/,"2,847 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.445,0,-0.771,0.25,0,0,-0.479,0,0,0,-0.479,0,0,0,-0.651,0,-0.445,0,0,0,Large,7.33415568,24.21773402,11.30298407,0,8.723226671,22775,0,0,0.640969163,,

Banca Mediolanum,Public,Italy,Financial Services and Banking,"Banca Mediolanum S.p.A. is an Italian bank, insurance and asset management conglomerate which is the parent company of Gruppo Mediolanum (Mediolanum Group). The CEO of the company is Massimo Antonio Doris, and the bank is listed on the Borsa Italiana and is a constituent of the FTSE MIB index from the end of 2015 when it incorporated it parent company Mediolanum S.p.A. Mediolanum Group was founded by Ennio Doris, the current second largest shareholders of the conglomerate. The conglomerate provided asset management, banking, insurances services to customers in Italy, Spain (as Banco Mediolanum and Fibanc) and Germany (Bankhaus August Lenz & Co.)Despite being ranked sixth by market capitalization among financial services companies (behind Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Assicurazioni Generali, UnipolSai and Mediobanca in 2016), the conglomerate (Mediolanum S.p.A.) was ranked 13th by total assets among bank (2014 data), as well as much smaller in size by risk-weighed assets, thus the conglomerate (Mediolanum S.p.A nor Banca Mediolanum) was not included in the Single Supervisory Mechanism. However, after Banca Mediolanum reversed the merger with Mediolanum, the European Central Bank started a comprehensive assessment to assess the conglomerate and decided the conglomerate would not be included. Eventually, Banca Mediolanum remained as a less-significant bank, which would not be supervised by the European Central Bank directly.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.bancamediolanum.it,"3,513 (Demandbase, 2022)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0.032,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.012,0,0,0,0.038,0,0,0,0.064,0,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,3.574285714,33.18770924,28.46979231,0.513333333,11.29148238,7103,0,0,0.850220264,,

DuPont,Public,USA,Industrial and Manufacturing,"DuPont de Nemours, Inc., commonly shortened to DuPont, is an American multinational chemical company first formed in 1802 by French-American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours. The company played a major role in the development of Delaware and first arose as a major supplier of gunpowder. DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam and Lycra in the 20th century, and its scientists developed many chemicals, most notably Freon (chlorofluorocarbons), for the refrigerant industry. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.In 2015, DuPont and the Dow Chemical Company agreed to a reorganization plan in which the two companies would merge and split into three. As a merged entity, DuPont simultaneously acquired Dow and renamed itself to DowDuPont on August 31, 2017, and after 18 months spun off the merged entity's material science divisions into a new corporate entity bearing Dow Chemical's name and agribusiness divisions into the newly-created Corteva; DowDuPont reverted its name to DuPont and kept the specialty products divisions. Prior to the spinoffs it was the world's largest chemical company in terms of sales. The merger has been reported to be worth an estimated $130 billion. The present DuPont, as prior to the merger, is headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, in the state where it is incorporated.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.dupont.com,"23,000 (Demandbase, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0.063,0,0,0,0,0,0.106,0,0.029,0,0.25,0,0.183,0,0,0,0.141,0,0,0,0,-0.046,0.035,0,0,-0.012,0,Large,0.397538596,40.09388331,21.62527937,12.14324318,11.29800711,14184,0,0,0.81938326,,

IBM,Public,USA,Financial Services and Banking,"The International Business Machines Corporation (doing business as IBM), nicknamed Big Blue, is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York and is present in over 175 countries. It specializes in computer hardware, middleware, and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 19 research facilities across a dozen countries, and has held the record for most annual U.S. patents generated by a business for 29 consecutive years from 1993 to 2021.IBM was founded in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR), a holding company of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed ""International Business Machines"" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of punch-card tabulating systems. For the next several decades, IBM would become an industry leader in several emerging technologies, including electric typewriters, electromechanical calculators, and personal computers. During the 1960s and 1970s, the IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform, and the company produced 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide.After pioneering the multipurpose microcomputer in the 1980s, which set the standard for personal computers, IBM began losing its market dominance to emerging competitors. Beginning in the 1990s, the company began downsizing its operations and divesting from commodity production, most notably selling its personal computer division to the Lenovo Group in 2005. IBM has since concentrated on computer services, software, supercomputers, and scientific research. Since 2000, its supercomputers have consistently ranked among the most powerful in the world, and in 2001 it became the first company to generate more than 3,000 patents in one year, beating this record in 2008 with over 4,000 patents. As of 2022, the company held 150,000 patents.As one of the world's oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several technological innovations, including the automated teller machine (ATM), dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, and the UPC barcode. The company has made inroads in advanced computer chips, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and data infrastructure. IBM employees and alumni have won various recognitions for their scientific research and inventions, including six Nobel Prizes and six Turing Awards.IBM is a publicly traded company and one of 30 companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It is among the world's largest employers, with over 297,900 employees worldwide in 2022. Despite its relative decline within the technology sector, IBM remains the seventh largest technology company by revenue, and 49th largest overall, according to the 2022 Fortune 500. It is also consistently ranked among the world's most recognizable, valuable, and admired brands.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.ibm.com/,"307,600 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.406,0,0.246,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,12.03376265,9.118837608,32.9015838,0,11.30911759,60500,0,0,,,

As of December 31, 2018, the company had 168 branches in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Virginia.First National Bank began in Orangeburg, South Carolina in 1933. In 2002, the bank changed its name to South Carolina Bank and Trust and moved its headquarters to Columbia, South Carolina. As of 2013, 240 people still worked in Orangeburg. SCBT added offices in the Greenville, South Carolina area as well. First National Corp. changed its name to SCBT Financial Corp. in 2003. The bank was South Carolina's fourth largest with $1 billion in assets.On November 30, 2007, SCBT Financial Corp. completed its acquisition of TSB Financial Corporation and its bank The Scottish Bank, giving SCBT four Charlotte, North Carolina locations and a loan production office in Cornelius, North Carolina.  The five locations changed their names to North Carolina Bank and Trust, or NCBT.In 2013, SCBT Financial Corp. announced a merger with First Financial Holdings of Charleston, started in 1934, which had 66 Carolinas locations and was the third-largest financial institution with headquarters in South Carolina. SCBT had 82 locations in 19 counties in South Carolina, 10 counties in north Georgia, two counties on the Georgia coast and in Mecklenburg County in North Carolina. SCBT president and CEO Robert R. Hill Jr. would remain as CEO, and chair Robert R. Horger would be chair. First Financial president and CEO R. Wayne Hall would become president of the merged company, and First Financial chair Paula Harper Bethea would be vice chair.The $447 million deal for First Financial was the biggest ever for SCBT Financial, which became the owner of five banks—SCBT; First Federal Bank of Charleston; NCBT of Charlotte, North Carolina; Community Bank & Trust of Cornelia, Georgia; and the Savannah Bank of coastal Georgia.

South State added 43 branches, five in Georgia, 23 in South Carolina, 17 in North Carolina and 8 in Virginia.On June 8, 2020, SouthState completed a merger with CenterState Bank.  The new bank will keep the SouthState name, but move its headquarters to Winter Haven, Florida.

Walt Disney,Public,USA,Media and Entertainment,"The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney (), is an American multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate that is headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios complex in Burbank, California. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy Disney as Disney Brothers Studio; it also operated under the names Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney Productions before changing its name to The Walt Disney Company in 1986. Early in its existence, the company established itself as a leader in the animation industry, with the creation of the widely popular character Mickey Mouse, who first appeared in Steamboat Willie, which used synchronized sound, to become the first post-produced sound cartoon. The character would go on to become the company's mascot and corporate icon.After becoming a major success by the early 1940s, the company diversified into live-action films, television, and theme parks in the 1950s. Following Walt Disney's death in 1966, the company's profits, especially in the animation division, began to decline. Once Disney's shareholders voted Michael Eisner as the head of the company in 1984, it became overwhelmingly successful during a period called the Disney Renaissance. In 2005, under new CEO Bob Iger, the company started to expand and acquire other corporations. Bob Chapek became the head of Disney in 2020 after Iger's retirement. Chapek was ousted in 2022 and Iger was reinstated as CEO.Since the 1980s, Disney has created and acquired corporate divisions to market more mature content than is typically associated with its family-oriented brands. The company is known for its film-studio division Walt Disney Studios, which includes Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, 20th Century Animation, and Searchlight Pictures. Disney's other main business units include divisions in television, broadcasting, streaming media, theme park resorts, consumer products, publishing, and international operations. Through these divisions, Disney owns and operates the ABC broadcast network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, FX, and National Geographic; publishing, merchandising, music, and theater divisions; direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Disney+, Star+, ESPN+, Hulu, and Hotstar; and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, which includes several theme parks, resort hotels, and cruise lines around the world.Disney is one of the biggest and best-known companies in the world, and has been ranked number 53 on the 2022 Fortune 500 list of biggest companies in the United States by revenue. Since its founding, the company has won 135 Academy Awards, 26 of which have been awarded to Walt. The company has been said to have produced some of the greatest films of all time, as well as revolutionizing the theme park industry. Disney has been criticized for supposed plagiarism, depicting racial stereotypes in the past, and both including and lacking LGBT-related elements in its films. The company, which has been public since 1940, trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with ticker symbol DIS and has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 1991. In August 2020, just under two-thirds of the stock was owned by large financial institutions.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",thewaltdisneycompany.com,"190,000 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.015,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.127,0,0,0,0,0,-0.012,0,Mega,8.8176004,22.94849171,38.42981408,0,12.10629524,63591,0,0,0.848017621,,

Spotify,Public,Sweden,Media and Entertainment,"Spotify (; Swedish: [ˈspɔ̂tːɪfaj]) is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 551 million monthly active users, including 220 million paying subscribers, as of June 2023. Spotify is listed (through a Luxembourg City-domiciled holding company, Spotify Technology S.A.) on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depositary receipts.Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded audio content, including more than 100 million songs and five million podcasts, from record labels and media companies. As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions. Users can search for music based on artist, album, or genre, and can create, edit, and share playlists.Spotify is available in most of Europe, as well as Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Oceania, with a total availability in 184 markets. Its users and subscribers are based largely in the US and Europe, jointly accounting for around 53% of users and 67% of revenue. It has no presence in mainland China where the market is dominated by QQ Music. The service is available on most devices, including Windows, macOS, and Linux computers, iOS and Android smartphones and tablets, smart home devices such as the Amazon Echo and Google Nest lines of products, and digital media players like Roku.Unlike physical or download sales, which pay artists a fixed price per song or album sold, Spotify pays royalties based on the number of artist streams as a proportion of total songs streamed. It distributes approximately 70% of its total revenue to rights holders (often record labels), who then pay artists based on individual agreements.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.spotify.com,"6,617 (Annual report, 2021)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Large,3.214285714,36.60609398,34.52816236,0,12.43799559,11026,0,0,0.962555066,,

AT&T,Public,USA,Telecommunications,"AT&T Inc. (with ""AT&T"" being an abbreviation for its former name, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company) is an American multinational telecommunications holding company headquartered at Whitacre Tower in Downtown Dallas, Texas. It is the world's third-largest telecommunications company by revenue and the largest wireless carrier in the United States. As of 2023, AT&T was ranked 13th on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations, with revenues of $120.7 billion.During most of the 20th century, AT&T had a monopoly on phone service in the United States. The company began its history as the American District Telegraph Company, formed in St. Louis in 1878. After expanding services to Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas through a series of mergers, it became Southwestern Bell Telephone Company in 1920, which was then a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The latter was a successor of the original Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell in 1877. The American Bell Telephone Company formed the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) subsidiary in 1885. In 1899, AT&T became the parent company after the American Bell Telephone Company sold its assets to its subsidiary. The company was rebranded as AT&T Corp. in 1994. The 1982 United States v. AT&T antitrust lawsuit resulted in the divestiture of AT&T's (""Ma Bell"") local operating subsidiaries which were grouped into seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), commonly referred to as ""Baby Bells"", resulting in seven independent companies, including Southwestern Bell Corporation (SBC). The latter changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995.In 2005, SBC purchased its former parent AT&T Corp. and took on the latter's branding, history, and stock trading symbol, as well as a version of its iconic logo. The merged entity, naming itself AT&T Inc., launched on December 30, 2005. The newly merged and renamed AT&T Inc. acquired BellSouth Corporation in 2006, the last independent Baby Bell company, making BellSouth and SBC (AT&T Inc.)'s formerly joint venture Cingular Wireless (which had itself acquired AT&T Wireless in 2004) a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Inc. Cingular was then rebranded as AT&T Mobility. AT&T Inc. also acquired Time Warner in 2016, with the proposed merger confirmed on June 12, 2018 and the aim of making AT&T Inc. the largest and controlling shareholder of Time Warner, which it then rebranded as WarnerMedia in 2018. The company later withdrew its equity stake in WarnerMedia in 2022 and merged it with Discovery, Inc. to create Warner Bros. Discovery, divesting itself of its media arm.The current AT&T reconstitutes most of the former Bell System, and includes four of the seven ""Baby Bells"" along with the original AT&T Corp., including the long-distance division.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.att.com,"160,700 (Demandbase, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.045,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.045,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,4.982595502,28.22586066,47.07247012,0,12.78969574,130356,0,0,0.876651982,,

Twitter,Public,USA,Media and Entertainment,"Twitter, rebranding to X since July 2023, is an online social media and social networking service operated by the American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc. On Twitter, registered users can post text, images and videos. Users can post (tweet); like, repost (or retweet), quote or comment on posts; and direct message other registered users. Users interact with Twitter through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via its application programming interfaces (APIs).Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. It was launched in July of that year. Its former parent company, Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California and had more than 25 offices around the world. By 2012, more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as ""the SMS of the Internet"". By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. In practice, the vast majority of tweets are produced by a minority of users. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million accounts (15% of all accounts) were not genuine people.In October 2022, billionaire Elon Musk acquired Twitter for US$44 billion, gaining control of the platform and becoming CEO. Since the acquisition, the platform has been criticized for facilitating an increase in content containing hate speech. Linda Yaccarino succeeded Musk as CEO on June 5, 2023, with Musk remaining as Chairman and CTO. In July 2023, Musk announced that Twitter will be rebranded to X and that the bird logo will be phased out.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",twitter.com/,"4,900 (Demandbase, 2020)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.258,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.492,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,6.794433595,30.48685535,25.45744491,4.736099069,12.83899838,3322,0,0,0.803964758,,

HSBC,Public,United Kingdom,Financial Services and Banking,"HSBC Holdings plc (Chinese: 滙豐; formerly known as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) is a British universal bank and financial services group headquartered in London, England, with unique historical and business links to East Asia and a highly multinational footprint. It is the largest Europe-based bank by total assets, ahead of BNP Paribas, with US$2.953 trillion as of December 2021. In 2021, HSBC had $10.8 trillion in assets under custody (AUC) and $4.9 trillion in assets under administration (AUA).HSBC traces its origin to a hong trading house in British Hong Kong. The bank opened branches in Shanghai in 1865 and was first formally incorporated in 1866. In 1991, the present parent legal entity, HSBC Holdings plc, was established in London and the historic Hong-Kong-based bank from whose initials the group took its name became that entity's fully-owned subsidiary. The next year (1992), HSBC took over Midland Bank and thus became one of the largest domestic banks in the United Kingdom. HSBC has offices, branches and subsidiaries in 62 countries and territories across Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America, serving around 39 million customers. As of 2023, it was ranked no. 20 in the world in the Forbes rankings of large companies ranked by sales, profits, assets, and market value. HSBC has a dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the Hang Seng Index and the FTSE 100 Index. It has secondary listings on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Bermuda Stock Exchange.HSBC has been implicated in a number of controversies and the bank has been repeatedly fined for money laundering (sometimes in relation to major criminal organizations such as the Sinaloa cartel) or setting up large scale tax avoidance schemes.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.hsbc.com/,"219,199 (Annual report, 2022)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.255,0,0.082,0,0,0,0.029,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,2.592441776,37.75201563,30.75937825,12.91626667,13.63999206,74891,1,0,0.81938326,,

PepsiCo,Public,USA,Consumer Goods,"PepsiCo, Inc. is an American multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation headquartered in Harrison, New York, in the hamlet of Purchase. PepsiCo's business encompasses all aspects of the food and beverage market. It oversees the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of its products. PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay, Inc., PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi Cola to an immensely diversified range of food and beverage brands. The largest and most recent acquisition was Pioneer Foods in 2020 for US$1.7 billion and prior to it was buying the Quaker Oats Company in 2001, which added the Gatorade brand to the Pepsi portfolio and Tropicana Products in 1998.As of January 2021, the company possesses 23 brands that have over US$1 billion in sales annually. PepsiCo has operations all around the world and its products were distributed across more than 200 countries, resulting in annual net revenues of over US$70 billion. PepsiCo is the second-largest food and beverage business in the world based on net revenue, profit, and market capitalization, behind Nestlé. PepsiCo's flagship product, Pepsi Cola has been engaged in a rivalry for generations with Coca-Cola; it is commonly referred to as the cola wars. Although Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi Cola in the United States, PepsiCo within the North American market is the largest food and beverage company by net revenue. Ramon Laguarta has been the chief executive of PepsiCo since 2018. The company's beverage distribution and bottling is conducted by PepsiCo as well as by licensed bottlers in certain regions.Pepsi has been repeatedly criticized by environmentalists for its relationship to negative environmental impacts of agriculture in its supply chain and in its distributing operations, such as palm oil–related deforestation and pesticide use, its use of water resources, and the negative impacts of its packaging—Pepsi's packaging has consistently been one of the top sources of plastic pollution globally.  Similarly public health advocates have criticized Pepsi's high-calorie, poor nutrition product lines along with other popular snack and drink manufacturers. In response PepsiCo has made public comments on its commitment to minimizing their impact but has not released public information documenting progress on most of its public commitments.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.pepsico.com,"309,000 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0.066,-0.149,0,-0.168,0,0,0,0,0,-0.189,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,17.83268052,13.70802106,35.26468043,0,14.92799015,79474,0,0,0.658590308,,

Nokia,Public,Finland,Telecommunications,"Nokia Corporation (natively Nokia Oyj in Finnish and Nokia Abp in Swedish, referred to as Nokia) is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics corporation, established in 1865. Nokia's main headquarters are in Espoo, Finland, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area, but the company's actual roots are in the Tampere region of Pirkanmaa. In 2020, Nokia employed approximately 92,000 people across over 100 countries, did business in more than 130 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €23 billion. Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. It was the world's 415th-largest company measured by 2016 revenues, according to the Fortune Global 500, having peaked at 85th place in 2009. It is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.The company has operated in various industries over the past 150 years. It was founded as a pulp mill and had long been associated with rubber and cables, but since the 1990s has focused on large-scale telecommunications infrastructure, technology development, and licensing. Nokia made significant contributions to the mobile telephony industry, assisting in the development of the GSM, 3G, and LTE standards. For a decade beginning in 1998, Nokia was the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones. In the later 2000s, however, Nokia suffered from a series of poor management decisions, and soon saw its share of the mobile phone market drop sharply.After a partnership with Microsoft and Nokia's subsequent market struggles, in 2014 Microsoft bought Nokia's mobile phone business, incorporating it as Microsoft Mobile. After the sale, Nokia began to focus more on its telecommunications infrastructure business and on Internet of things technologies, marked by the divestiture of its Here mapping division and the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, including its Bell Labs research organization. The company then also experimented with virtual reality and digital health, the latter through the purchase of Withings. The Nokia brand returned to the mobile and smartphone market in 2016 through a licensing arrangement with HMD Global. Nokia continues to be a major patent licensor for most large mobile phone vendors.

GEO,Public,USA,Government and Public Sector,"The GEO Group, Inc. (GEO) is a publicly traded  C corporation that invests in private prisons and mental health facilities in North America, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, the company's facilities include illegal immigration detention centers, minimum security detention centers, and mental-health and residential-treatment facilities. It also operates government-owned facilities pursuant to management contracts. As of December 31, 2021, the company managed and/or owned 86,000 beds at 106 facilities. In 2019, agencies of the federal government of the United States generated 53% of the company's revenues. Up until 2021 the company was designated as a real estate investment trust, at which time the board of directors elected to reclassify as a C corporation under the stated goal of reducing the company's debt.The company has been the subject of civil suits in the United States by prisoners and families of prisoners for injuries due to riots and poor treatment at prisons and immigrant detention facilities which it has operated. In addition, due to settlement of a class-action suit in 2012 for its management of Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in Mississippi, the GEO Group lost its contract for this and two other Mississippi prisons (which it had been operating since 2010). Related federal investigations of kickback and bribery schemes associated with nearly $1 billion in Mississippi state contracts for prisons and related services have resulted in the criminal prosecution of several public officials in the state. In February 2017, the state attorney general announced a civil suit for damages, to recover monies from contracts completed in the period of corruption. In August 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice announced its intention to phase out contracts with privately operated prisons. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was reviewing its contracts with private firms, which operate several immigrant detention facilities. In the spring of 2017, officials of the Donald Trump administration said they would be reviewing this policy. In September 2019, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that he would terminate California's contract with GEO's Central Valley Modified Community Correctional Facility in McFarland.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",thegeogroupinc.com/,"15,800 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0.034,0,0.545,0,0.136,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.403,0,0,0,0.136,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,5.692346939,42.55575134,31.28586113,7.566666667,15.34203269,2314,0,0,0.949339207,,

Eastman Kodak,Public,USA,Consumer Goods,"The Eastman Kodak Company (referred to simply as Kodak ) is an American public company that produces various products related to its historic basis in analogue photography. The company is headquartered in Rochester, New York, and is incorporated in New Jersey. It is best known for photographic film products, which it brought to a mass market for the first time.Kodak began as a partnership between George Eastman and Henry A. Strong to develop a film roll camera. After the release of the Kodak camera, Eastman Kodak was incorporated on May 23, 1892. Under Eastman's direction, the company became one of the world's largest film and camera manufacturers, and also developed a model of welfare capitalism and a close relationship with the city of Rochester. During most of the 20th century, Kodak held a dominant position in photographic film, and produced a number of technological innovations through heavy investment in research and development at Kodak Research Laboratories. Kodak produced some of the most popular camera models of the 20th century, including the Brownie and Instamatic. The company's ubiquity was such that its ""Kodak moment"" tagline entered the common lexicon to describe a personal event that deserved to be recorded for posterity.Kodak began to struggle financially in the late 1990s as a result of increasing competition from Fujifilm. The company also struggled with the transition from film to digital photography, although Kodak had developed the first self-contained digital camera. Attempts to diversify its chemical operations failed, and as a turnaround strategy in the 2000s, Kodak instead made an aggressive turn to digital photography and digital printing. These strategies failed to improve the company's finances, and in January 2012, Kodak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.In September 2013, the company emerged from bankruptcy, having shed its large legacy liabilities, restructured, and exited several businesses. Since emerging from bankruptcy, Kodak has continued to provide commercial digital printing products and services, motion picture film, and still film, the last of which is distributed through the spinoff company Kodak Alaris. The company has licensed the Kodak brand to several products produced by other companies, such as the PIXPRO line of digital cameras manufactured by JK Imaging. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Kodak announced in late July that year it would begin production of pharmaceutical materials.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.kodak.com/,"4,200 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0.048,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.016,0.048,0,0.262,0,0.056,0,0,0,0.024,0,0,0,0.016,-0.129,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,10.6677551,33.79051394,30.79851058,1.271111111,15.74628565,1150,0,0,0.799559471,,

It is the holding company for the Adidas Group, which also owns an 8.33% stake of the football club Bayern München, and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas's revenue for 2018 was listed at €21.915 billion.The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house. He was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (""Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory""). Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival.The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey, became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as ""The three stripes company"".CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.adidas-group.com/,"61,401 (Demandbase, 2021)",Europe,0,0,0,0,0.011,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.179,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Large,11.78823502,34.6517962,30.01170503,2.86180268,16.61232485,21334,0,0,0.759911894,,

Apple,Public,USA,Consumer Goods,"Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. As of March 2023, Apple is the world's biggest company by market capitalization, and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue. As of June 2022, Apple is the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales; the largest manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by  Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs (1955–2011) and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called ""1984"". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as ""Wintel""). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back to profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical acclaim, launching the ""Think different"" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the Apple Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3 trillion. The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.apple.com/,"164,000 (Annual report, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.297,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.261,0,0.03,0,0,0,0,0,0.025,-0.311,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,19.71596847,19.01091755,48.09645118,0,17.34245181,394328,0,0,0.859030837,,

Microsoft,Public,USA,Technology,"Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft's best-known software products are the Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022. It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta Platforms.Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.As of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android. The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000 and later envisioned a ""devices and services"" strategy. This unfolded with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008, entering the personal computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has scaled back on hardware and instead focused on cloud computing, a move that helped the company's shares reach their highest value since December 1999.Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018, Microsoft reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. In April 2019, Microsoft reached a trillion-dollar market cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1 trillion after Apple and Amazon, respectively. As of 2022, Microsoft has the fourth-highest global brand valuation.Microsoft has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.microsoft.com/,"181,000 (Annual report, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.017,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.404,0,0.193,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.065,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,16.07995486,27.39699959,43.64151314,0,18.10319136,168000,0,0,0.878854626,,

It is one of the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue, and is one of the developers of the x86 series of instruction sets found in most personal computers (PCs). Incorporated in Delaware, Intel ranked No. 45 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue for nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016 fiscal years.Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system manufacturers such as Acer, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing.Intel (Integrated electronics) was founded on July 18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore (of Moore's law), Robert Noyce (1927–1990), Arthur Rock (venture capitalist) and is associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove. Intel was a key component of the rise of Silicon Valley as a high-tech center. Noyce was a key inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip). Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business.During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period, Intel became the dominant supplier of PC microprocessors and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against AMD, as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry.The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland, Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html,"121,100 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.254,0,0.499,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,15.09695999,28.86706454,42.19465014,0,18.10691081,79024,0,0,0.821585903,,

It operates buses, express coaches and a tram service in the United Kingdom.Stagecoach was originally founded in 1976 as Gloagtrotter, a recreational vehicle and minibus hire business. During the early 1980s, it took advantage of the deregulation of the British express coach market, launching services from Dundee to London using second-hand Neoplan coaches, competing against the then state-owned National Express Coaches and Scottish Citylink. Stagecoach purchased several recently-privatised national bus groups from London Regional Transport, the National Bus Company, Scottish Bus Group and various city councils, as well as pursuing those that had opted for management buyouts and employee-owned corporations. During August 1996, Stagecoach acquired roughly one-third of all passenger rolling stock in the UK via the acquisition of the recently-privatised leasing company Porterbrook; it sold the company on four years later. In 1997, Stagecoach was awarded the franchise to operate the recently privatised Sheffield Supertram system. In 1998, it purchased Prestwick Airport.Following the sale of its London bus operations to Macquarie Bank in 2006, Stagecoach UK Bus concentrated on the bus market outside the UK capital. During 2007, the Virgin Rail Group, which Stagecoach held a 49% stake in, was awarded the East Midlands franchise. In July 2007, it commenced operating the Manchester Metrolink tram network. During January 2009, Stagecoach purchased Preston Bus, a former rival in the Lancashire area, but was promptly compelled to sell it by the Competition Commission. In October 2010, it expanded further by re-acquiring East London and Selkent, Stagecoach's former London bus operations. During March 2015, Virgin Trains East Coast, in which Stagecoach held a 90% shareholding, commenced operating the InterCity East Coast franchise; the franchise was terminated early three years later as it was unable to fulfil the agreed payments.During April 2019, private equity house Variant acquired Stagecoach's US division in exchange for $271 million. In April 2019, Stagecoach was disqualified from participating in three rail franchise competitions by the Department for Transport after it submitted non-compliant bids. During September 2021, it was reported that rival company National Express entered into talks to acquire Stagecoach. In May 2022, a rival takeover offer from a DWS managed investment fund bought Stagecoach.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.stagecoach.com,"24,000 (Demandbase, 2020)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0.016,-0.491,0,0,0,-0.492,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,21.04591837,24.0625,2.819196429,18.33333333,18.35750957,1453,0,0,,,

Go-Ahead,Public,United Kingdom,Transportation and Logistics,"The Go-Ahead Group plc is a passenger transport company based in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The majority of its operations are within the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore, Norway, and Germany. Go-Ahead was formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange prior to being purchased by Kinetic Group and Globalvia by 2022.The Go-Ahead Group was originally founded in February 1987 as Go-Ahead Northern Limited as part of the wider privatisation of the National Bus Company. Early expansion centred around the acquisition of several smaller competing bus operators in North East England and operating as a subcontractor to National Express; during the early 1990s, the Brighton & Hove, Oxford Bus Company, and London Central were all acquired. During May 1994, Go-Ahead was floated on the London Stock Exchange. In October 1996, Go-Ahead entered the UK railway sector via the operation of the Thames Trains franchise. Via the Govia joint venture, it bid for additional rail franchises in Britain, securing the Thameslink and later the Southeastern and London Midland operations. During mid 2000, the French state-owned enterprise Caisse des Dépts-Développement (C3D) attempted a hostile takeover of Go-Ahead, which was successfully opposed by its management team.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Go-Ahead diversified into ground handling services at various British airports via the acquisition of Gatwick Handling International, British Midland, and Reed Aviation. During 2010, Go-Ahead disposed of its airport-based operations, the majority being sold to Dnata UK and Servisair. During the early 2010s, Go-Ahead acquired numerous other British transport companies, including Thames Travel, Carousel Buses, Hedingham, Anglian Bus, and HC Chambers & Son. During late 2015, it was contracted to operate bus and rail services in Germany and Singapore; in subsequent years, Go-Ahead also expanded into Ireland and Norway. On 28 September 2021, Britain's Department for Transport terminated Go-Ahead's Southeastern franchise after the discovery of financial misconduct. During August 2022, a consortium of Australia's Kinetic Group (51%) and Spain's Globalvia (49%) took over Go-Ahead, having valued the company at £669 million. During January 2023, it was announced that Go-Ahead was expanding into the Australian market via the U-Go Mobility joint venture with the engineering company UFL.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.go-ahead.com/,"30,000 (Demandbase, 2020)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.276,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0.551,-0.224,0,0,0.276,-0.224,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,21.04591837,24.0625,12.02544643,18.33333333,19.73844707,5590,0,0,,,

Verizon Communications,Public,USA,Telecommunications,"Verizon Communications Inc. () is an American multinational telecommunications conglomerate. The company is incorporated in Delaware, and headquartered at 1095 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Verizon's capital stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.The company was formed in 1984 as Bell Atlantic, due to the breakup of the Bell System into seven companies, each a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), commonly referred to as ""Baby Bells."" The company was originally headquartered in Philadelphia and operated in the states of New Jersey and Virginia. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. While Bell Atlantic was the surviving company, the merged company moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to NYNEX's old headquarters in New York City. In 2000, Bell Atlantic acquired GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving entity, changed its name to Verizon, a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for ""truth"") and horizon.In 2015, Verizon expanded into content ownership by acquiring AOL, and two years later, it acquired Yahoo! Inc. AOL and Yahoo were amalgamated into a new division named Oath Inc., which was rebranded as Verizon Media in January 2019, and was spun off and rebranded to Yahoo after its sale to Apollo Global Management.As of 2016, Verizon is one of three remaining companies with roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. SBC Communications bought the Bells' former parent AT&T Corporation and took on the AT&T name, and CenturyLink acquired Qwest (formerly US West) in 2011 and later became Lumen Technologies in 2020.Verizon's mobile network is the second-largest wireless carrier in the United States, with 143.3 million subscribers as of the end of Q2 2023. It also sells accessories and gear for mobiles and PCs.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.verizon.com/,"118,400 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.083,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.446,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.083,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mega,12.99454931,35.81305089,47.81173007,1.028769333,19.84503466,133613,1,0,0.881057269,,

MGM Resorts,Public,USA,Leisure and Recreation,"MGM Resorts International is an American global hospitality and entertainment company operating destination resorts in Las Vegas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Maryland, Ohio, and New Jersey, including Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, and Park MGM.The company began operations in 1987 as MGM Grand, Inc. and became MGM Mirage in 2000, after acquiring Mirage Resorts. In the mid-2000s, growth of its non-gaming (lodging, food, retail) revenue began to outpace gaming receipts and demand for high-rise condominiums was surging, with median property prices in Las Vegas twice the national average. The company shifted its focus from owning and operating resorts and casinos to developing and building real estate in the leisure and gaming industry—launching the massive CityCenter mixed-use project, which was at the time of its construction the world's largest construction site and ranks as one of the most expensive real estate projects in history. City Center's development coincided with the global financial crisis, causing more than $1 billion in writedowns in its valuation.Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corporation were, until 2009, the majority shareholders of MGM Mirage;  Kerkorian was the former owner of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie studio, from which MGM Grand derived its name. Following a $1 billion stock offering by MGM Mirage amidst the global credit crunch, Tracinda's shares were diluted from 53.8 percent to 39 percent. On June 15, 2010, shareholders voted for MGM Mirage to change its name to ""MGM Resorts International"".In 2015, the company split into two forming MGM Growth Properties, a real estate company, while MGM Resorts shifted to operating properties.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.mgmresorts.com/en.html,"46,000 (Demandbase, 2022)",North America,0,0,0.01,0,0,-0.04,0,0,0,0,0,-0.042,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-0.01,0,Large,19.56552071,32.80069306,24.62648055,5.936187296,20.26554053,13127,0,0,0.678414097,,

The company's review system's reliability has also been affected by the submission of fake reviews by external users, such as false positive reviews submitted by a company to promote its own business or false negative reviews submitted about competing businesses –  a practice sometimes known as ""astroturfing"", which the company has tried to combat in various ways.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.yelp.com/,"3,900 (Demandbase, 2020)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.275,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,17.66897757,31.68562225,33.84040725,7.80854228,20.71812343,1032,0,0,0.834801762,,

Bank of America,Public,USA,Financial Services and Banking,"The Bank of America Corporation (often abbreviated BofA or BoA) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services holding company headquartered at the Bank of America Corporate Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, with investment banking and auxiliary headquarters in Manhattan. The bank was founded in San Francisco, California. It is the second-largest banking institution in the United States, after JPMorgan Chase, and the second-largest bank in the world by market capitalization. Bank of America is one of the Big Four banking institutions of the United States. It serves approximately 10.73% of all American bank deposits, in direct competition with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. Its primary financial services revolve around commercial banking, wealth management, and investment banking.One branch of its history stretches back to the U.S.-based Bank of Italy, founded by Amadeo Pietro Giannini in 1904, which provided various banking options to Italian immigrants who faced service discrimination. Originally headquartered in San Francisco, California, Giannini acquired Banca d'America e d'Italia (Bank of America and Italy) in 1922. The passage of landmark federal banking legislation facilitated a rapid growth in the 1950s, quickly establishing a prominent market share. After suffering a significant loss after the 1998 Russian bond default, BankAmerica, as it was then known, was acquired by the Charlotte-based NationsBank for US$62 billion. Following what was then the largest bank acquisition in history, the Bank of America Corporation was founded. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, it built upon its commercial banking business by establishing Merrill Lynch for wealth management and Bank of America Merrill Lynch for investment banking in 2008 and 2009, respectively (since renamed BofA Securities).Both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management retain large market shares in their respective offerings. The investment bank is considered within the ""Bulge Bracket"" as the third largest investment bank in the world, as of 2018. Its wealth management side manages US$1.081 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as the second largest wealth manager in the world, after UBS. In commercial banking, Bank of America operates—but does not necessarily maintain—retail branches in all 50 states of the United States, the District of Columbia and more than 40 other countries. Its commercial banking footprint encapsulates 46 million consumer and small business relationships at 4,600 banking centers and 15,900 automated teller machines (ATMs).The bank's large market share, business activities, and economic impact has led to numerous lawsuits and investigations regarding both mortgages and financial disclosures dating back to the 2008 financial crisis. Its corporate practices of servicing the middle class and wider banking community have yielded a substantial market share since the early 20th century. As of August 2018, Bank of America has a $313.5 billion market capitalization, making it the 13th largest company in the world. As the sixth largest American public company, it garnered $102.98 billion in sales as of June 2018. Bank of America was ranked #25 on the 2020 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest US corporations by total revenue. Likewise, Bank of America was also ranked #6 on the 2023 Global 2000 rankings done by Forbes.

Texas Instruments,Public,USA,Technology,"Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) is an American technology company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, that designs and manufactures semiconductors and various integrated circuits, which it sells to electronics designers and manufacturers globally.  It is one of the top 10 semiconductor companies worldwide based on sales volume. The company's focus is on developing analog chips and embedded processors, which account for more than 80% of its revenue. TI also produces TI digital light processing technology and education technology products including calculators, microcontrollers, and multi-core processors. The company holds 45,000 patents worldwide as of 2016.Texas Instruments emerged in 1951 after a reorganization of Geophysical Service Incorporated, a company founded in 1930 that manufactured equipment for use in the seismic industry, as well as defense electronics. TI produced the world's first commercial silicon transistor in 1954, and the same year designed and manufactured the first transistor radio. Jack Kilby invented the integrated circuit in 1958 while working at TI's Central Research Labs. TI also invented the hand-held calculator in 1967, and introduced the first single-chip microcontroller  in 1970, which combined all the elements of computing onto one piece of silicon.In 1987, TI invented the digital light processing device (also known as the DLP chip), which serves as the foundation for the company's DLP technology and DLP Cinema. TI released the popular TI-81 calculator in 1990, which made it a leader in the graphing calculator industry. Its defense business was sold to Raytheon Company in 1997; this allowed TI to strengthen its focus on digital solutions. After the acquisition of National Semiconductor in 2011, the company had a combined portfolio of 45,000 analog products and customer design tools. In the stock market, Texas Instruments is often regarded as an indicator for the semiconductor and electronics industry as a whole, since the company sells to more than 100,000 customers.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.ti.com/,"33,000 (Company website, 2022)",North America,0.053,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.192,0,0.25,0,0.374,0,0,0,0.156,0,0,0,0.105,0,0,0,0,0,0,Large,21.79530396,40.65854933,36.55896543,12.75186918,25.48282477,20028,0,0,0.823788546,,

Supplying its precision watches to various clients, including the Admiralty, the business quickly grew and expanded into a major provider of timepieces, diamonds, and automotive instrumentation. On 21 July 1914, the business became a public limited company, holding onto this status for over a hundred years. Significant restructuring of Smiths Group took place during the 1950s, the foundations of Smiths Medical Systems division were laid while Smiths Aviation and Smiths Marine were organised as separate divisions. Throughout much of the twentieth century, Smiths Group was the principal supplier of instruments to the British motorcar and motorcycle industries, organising itself as Smiths Industries Ltd in 1960.By the late 1970s, the markets for clocks, watches, and automotive instruments had progressively decreased to the point where little of Smith's revenue came from these sources; Smiths Industries decided to cease its involvement as a direct supplier of Europe's automotive industry in the early 1980s. In 1984, Smiths Industries was reorganised into three principal operating divisions: Industrial, Medical Systems, and Aerospace and Defence. Smiths Aerospace became a key source of business for the wider group, supplying both military and civilian customers. The medical division of Smiths Group would ultimately by acquired by ICU Medical in January 2022. In the twenty-first century, the company's principal activities have been the manufacture of sensors that detect and identify explosives, products and services for the major process industries, products that connect, protect and control critical systems, and engineered components that heat and move fluids and gases.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",smiths-group.com,"15,250 (Demandbase, 2022)",Great Britain & Ireland,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.029,0,0.109,0,0.255,0,0.205,0,0,0,0.118,0,0.04,0,0.052,0,0.052,0,0,0,0,Medium,21.04591837,54.56926089,29.19559996,21.32777778,27.3391509,3131,0,0,0.821585903,,

Advanced Micro Devices,Public,USA,Technology,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., commonly abbreviated as AMD, is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.The company was founded in 1969 by Jerry Sanders and a group of other technology professionals. AMD's early products were primarily memory chips and other components for computers. The company later expanded into the microprocessor market, competing with Intel, its main rival in the industry. In the early 2000s, AMD experienced significant growth and success, thanks in part to its strong position in the PC market and the success of its Athlon and Opteron processors. However, the company faced challenges in the late 2000s and early 2010s, as it struggled to keep up with Intel in the race to produce faster and more powerful processors. In the late 2010s, AMD regained some of its market share thanks to the success of its Ryzen processors which are now widely regarded as superior to Intel products in business applications including cloud applications. AMD's processors are used in a wide range of computing devices, including personal computers, servers, laptops, and gaming consoles. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as going fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009.AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors, graphics processors, and FPGAs for servers, workstations, personal computers, and embedded system applications. The company has also expanded into new markets, such as the data center and gaming markets, and has announced plans to enter the high-performance computing market.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.amd.com/,"15,500 (Demandbase, 2021)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0,0.464,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Large,25.47614261,47.19767128,43.80567925,5.413333333,28.47438102,16434,0,0,0.828193833,,

Bayer,Public,Germany,Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals,"Bayer AG (, commonly pronounced ; German: [ˈbaɪɐ]) is a German multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company and is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Headquartered in Leverkusen, Bayer's areas of business include pharmaceuticals, consumer healthcare products, agricultural chemicals, seeds and biotechnology products. The company is a component of the EURO STOXX 50 stock market index.Bayer was founded in 1863 in Barmen as a partnership between dye salesman Friedrich Bayer (1825–1880) and dyer Friedrich Weskott (1821–1876). As was common in this era, the company was established as a dyestuffs producer. The versatility of aniline chemistry led Bayer to expand its business into other areas, and in 1899, Bayer launched the compound acetylsalicylic acid under the trademarked name Aspirin. In 1904, Bayer received a trademark for the ""Bayer Cross"" logo, which was subsequently stamped onto each aspirin tablet, creating an iconic product that is still sold by Bayer. Other commonly known products initially commercialized by Bayer include heroin, phenobarbital, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates.In 1925, Bayer merged with five other German companies to form IG Farben, creating the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical company. Following World War II, the Allied Control Council seized IG Farben's assets because of its role in the Nazi war effort and involvement in the Holocaust, including using slave labour from concentration camps and humans for dangerous medical testing, and production of Zyklon B, a chemical used in gas chambers. In 1951, IG Farben was split into its constituent companies, and Bayer was reincorporated as Farbenfabriken Bayer AG. Bayer played a key role in the Wirtschaftswunder in post-war West Germany, quickly regaining its position as one of the world's largest chemical and pharmaceutical corporations.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.bayer.de/,"101,914 (Demandbase, 2021)",Europe,0,0,0.343,0,0.414,-0.028,0,0,0.037,0,0,-0.137,0,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.027,0,0,0,0,-0.165,0.027,-0.082,0,Large,23.40708705,48.65014802,39.89354783,31.14670395,30.82745785,48731,0,1,0.892070485,,

SVB Financial,Public,USA,Financial Services and Banking,"Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was a state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It operated branches in California and Massachusetts. The bank was the primary subsidiary of SVB Financial Group, a publicly traded bank holding company that had offices in 15 U.S. states and over a dozen international jurisdictions.As a regional bank in the Bay Area, SVB offered services specifically designed to meet the needs of the tech industry, and soon became the largest bank by deposits in Silicon Valley and the preferred bank of almost half of all venture-backed tech startups. In March 2023, after central bank–endorsed interest rate hikes during the 2021–2023 inflation surge, there was a bank run on its deposits, which led to its collapse and seizure on March 10, 2023 by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI), its regulator. Citing inadequate liquidity and insolvency, state officials at the DFPI appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) receiver of the bank. This was, at the time, the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, later surpassed by the collapse of First Republic Bank during the March 2023 United States bank failures.On March 12, 2023, a joint statement was issued by Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, and FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg, stating that all depositors at SVB would be fully protected and would have access to both insured and uninsured deposits starting the following Monday, March 13. The FDIC then established a bridge bank successor, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A., which quickly assumed ongoing business. On March 27, 2023, First Citizens Bank & Trust Company, a subsidiary of First Citizens BancShares, assumed all customer deposits and acquired all loans of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank from the FDIC and began operating all SVB branches.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",www.svb.com/,"8,553 (Demandbase, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.268,0,0.175,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Medium,34.042762,44.63392477,42.55753831,2.041666667,32.10848856,6213,0,0,0.837004405,,

Visa,Public,USA,Financial Services and Banking,"Visa Inc. (; stylized as VISA) is an American multinational payment card services corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards. Visa is one of the world's most valuable companies.Visa does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for consumers; rather, Visa provides financial institutions with Visa-branded payment products that they then use to offer credit, debit, prepaid and cash access programs to their customers. In 2015, the Nilson Report, a publication that tracks the credit card industry, found that Visa's global network (known as VisaNet) processed 100 billion transactions during 2014 with a total volume of US$6.8 trillion.Visa was founded in 1958 by Bank of America (BofA) as the BankAmericard credit card program. In response to competitor Master Charge (now Mastercard), BofA began to license the BankAmericard program to other financial institutions in 1966. By 1970, BofA gave up direct control of the BankAmericard program, forming a cooperative with the other various BankAmericard issuer banks to take over its management. It was then renamed Visa in 1976.Nearly all Visa transactions worldwide are processed through the company's directly operated VisaNet at one of four secure data centers, located in Ashburn, Virginia; Highlands Ranch, Colorado; London, England; and Singapore. These facilities are heavily secured against natural disasters, crime, and terrorism; can operate independently of each other and from external utilities if necessary; and can handle up to 30,000 simultaneous transactions and up to 100 billion computations every second.Visa is the world's second-largest card payment organization (debit and credit cards combined), after being surpassed by China UnionPay in 2015, based on annual value of card payments transacted and number of issued cards. However, because UnionPay's size is based primarily on the size of its domestic market in China, Visa is still considered the dominant bankcard company in the rest of the world, where it commands a 50% market share of total card payments.CollapseSource: Wikipedia",usa.visa.com/,"26,500 (Annual report, 2022)",North America,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.292,0,0.244,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Large,40.12817847,51.46333282,42.17439584,19.95051444,39.10873462,29310,0,0,0.852422907,,

Goodnature Ltd,Private,New Zealand,Consumer Goods,"Goodnature wants to help biodiversity thrive with the world's smartest rodent traps. We understand the delicate balance of nature and our reliance on each other, and when the population of an invasive species becomes too big, it doesn't take long for native species to be reduced to dangerously low numbers. 

Rodents, in particular, have wreaked havoc for years in areas where they don't belong but the traditional methods used to tackle this problem, such as toxins, single-use traps, or glue boards, are even worse. They’re high-maintenance, inhumane and negatively impact the very environment we are trying to protect. Shockingly, this year has seen more toxins and throwaway traps than ever before. 

Goodnature was born in the New Zealand bush in 2005, from the realisation that keeping rodent population in check would require something far smarter, scalable and kinder. Ever since, Goodnature has been on a mission to solve this age-old problem and restore balance using smart technology. Half a million traps later, we’ve removed 22 million pests globally with traps that are automatic, self-resetting, toxin-free, and humane.

Since the beginning, Heath has always been committed to making our ceramic products and running our business in ways that support our people and the planet. Edith Heath’s earliest ceramics were designed to be fired at a lower temperature than the standard—an energy-saving practice we continue to this day.  We source our clay and manufacture our products in California, which keeps our carbon footprint light, and we recycle clay and water from our manufacturing process right back into the factory. In more recent decades, we have developed living wage and employee stock ownership opportunities that support our entire staff.",www.heathceramics.com,50-249,North America,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Micro,50,29.28060764,40.55849134,50,45.47586485,,,,,27.85114046,40.88050314

Build the best product
Their criteria for the best product rests on function, repairability, and, foremost, durability. Among the most direct ways they can limit ecological impacts is with goods that last for generations or can be recycled so the materials in them remain in use. Making the best product matters for saving the planet.

Cause no unnecessary harm
They know that their business activity—from lighting stores to dyeing shirts—is part of the problem. They work steadily to change their business practices and share what they’ve learned. But they recognize that this is not enough. They seek not only to do less harm, but more good.

Use business to protect nature
The challenges faced as a society require leadership. Once they identify a problem, they act. They embrace risk and act to protect and restore the stability, integrity and beauty of the web of life.
